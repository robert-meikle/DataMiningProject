# Data Mining Course Project
## Overview
The goal of this project is to use data mining techniques to predict future stock prices.  We have collected 10 year historical data for 10 different stocks to use for training and testing. (8 for training, 2 for testing).

## Data
For this project we have collected historical stock data for 10 different stocks.  For each day we have attributes including opening price, closing price, # of trades, high price, and low price.  We have a split of 8 stocks for training the various models and 2 stocks for testing purposes.  The testing stocks are Lowes, a notoriously stable and well performing stock, and Tesla, a notoriously volatile stock.
